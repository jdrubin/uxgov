For the mobility testing, **<AGENCY NAME>** has identified four mobile devices, selected for their popularity, which will be used when testing the website: the Android phone, Android tablet, iPhone and Ipad. The following sample plan includes four usability interviews per segment (for a total of 16 interviews), which each using a different device. Testing will take place across three days.

To boost cooperation during the recruit and better accommodate the schedules of high school students and parents, usability testing will take place from mid-afternoon to evening. In addition, floaters will be recruited to hedge against no-shows. Participants will receive an incentive of $75 (floaters will receive $125).
