4.1.2 Design Phase
The contractor will utilize the information gathered from the analysis phase to design a user interface
that is based on user-centered methodologies.
This work may include performing the following recommended activities:
 Design a user interface for trademark attorneys, managers, support staff, and other
stakeholders that meet standard usability criteria (learnability, efficiency, memorability, error
reduction, and user satisfaction) and that meet special criteria as determined by internal user
research (fast, simple, flexible, configurable, one interface, promotes collaboration and
communication, and supports integration of advanced tools such as intelligent search
analysis, supports data validation and auto-fill, and supports alerts and notifications and the
ability to handle various types and forms of attachments).
 Design the interface using an iterative, user-centered process with the expectation that
stakeholders will review and comment on designs, and those designs will be adjusted and retested
until satisfactory results are obtained. Much of the usability testing will be done by
government workers although the contractor will in some cases do usability testing as well.
 Design at least one interface but not more than two for review. Stakeholders will evaluate
each design, selecting the one that meets or exceeds the user identified
requirements/expectations for continued development. The government reserves the right
not to continue development of any proposed design during any phase.
 Develop artifacts for communication with stakeholders about the design, at all stages of the
design process (wireframes, storyboards, prototypes, graphic design, and so on). These
artifacts can include paper prototypes, video, web-accessible clickable prototypes, and other
materials. Artifacts that can be posted online will be emphasized in order to increase the
stakeholder feedback.
 Draft wireframes, storyboards and/or navigation models that document the design.
Develop prototype(s) to demonstrate a variety of GUI technologies to address Trademarks’
current interface concerns.
 Guide or conduct usability testing, surveys, and other forms of obtaining feedback on
prototype(s) where applicable.
 Design, evaluate, and write software requirements for additional functionality associated with
user research results.
 Create a draft prototype of the approved design.
